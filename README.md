## About the whole thing:
**snn-stdp.py** is the main program, all the info about the program is inside the file commented at the top.
**get-networks-accuracy.py** is used to get the accuracy of the network, info at the top of the file.
**read-pkl-spikes.py** is used to check the spikes from pkl files that were generated by **snn-stdp.py** 
during training and testing phases.

## How to use:
Will Fill up soon
